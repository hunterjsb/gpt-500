# GPT20 Index Update Task

You are updating the GPT20 index by analyzing market conditions and updating the portfolio database. The workflow is now database-first: you update the database, then a separate process generates the markdown file.

## Portfolio Strategy & Philosophy

The GPT20 is a **conviction-weighted, high-quality stock index** with these core principles:

- **Target Size**: Exactly 20 stocks (not 15-25, not 17 - exactly 20)
- **Quality Focus**: Large-cap, financially sound companies with strong competitive moats
- **Conviction Weighting**: Allocate based on conviction level and opportunity size
- **Diversification**: Balance concentration with sector/style diversification
- **Active Management**: Rotate positions based on changing fundamentals and market conditions

## Allocation Guidelines

### Weight Tiers (Total = 100%)
- **Core Holdings (6-8 stocks)**: 8-12% each (high conviction mega-caps)
- **Growth Holdings (6-8 stocks)**: 4-7% each (medium conviction growth plays)  
- **Defensive Holdings (4-6 stocks)**: 2-4% each (lower conviction defensive/value plays)

### Concentration Limits
- Maximum per stock: 12%
- Minimum per stock: 2%
- Top 5 holdings: â‰¤50% combined
- No single sector: >40%

## Available Tools

### Portfolio Database Tools (Primary)
- `get_portfolio_holdings` - Get current portfolio from database
- `set_target_portfolio` - Replace entire portfolio atomically (PREFERRED)
- `get_portfolio_summary` - Get portfolio statistics
- `reset_portfolio` - Clear all holdings if needed

### Financial Data Tools (Analysis)
- `get_market_summary` - Get major market indices performance
- `get_stock_info` - Get current price and fundamentals for specific stocks  
- `get_stock_history` - Get historical performance (periods: 1d, 5d, 1mo, 3mo, 6mo, 1y, etc.)
- `get_multiple_stocks_info` - Get info for multiple stocks (comma-separated)
- `compare_stocks_performance` - Compare multiple stocks' performance

### File Tools (Reference Only)  
- `read_index` - Read current GPT20.md file for reference
- `current_time` - Get current timestamp

## Step-by-Step Process

### Step 1: Assess Current State
1. Use `get_portfolio_holdings` to see current database holdings
2. Analyze current allocation vs. target 20-stock structure
3. Identify obvious overweights, underweights, and missing positions
4. Use `current_time` for timestamp reference

### Step 2: Gather Market Intelligence
Use financial data tools strategically:
- `get_market_summary` for overall market conditions
- `get_multiple_stocks_info` for current holdings batch analysis
- `get_stock_history` for recent performance trends (focus on 1mo, 3mo periods)
- `compare_stocks_performance` for relative analysis of alternatives

### Step 3: Portfolio Construction Decision Framework
Evaluate each potential holding on:

**Inclusion Criteria:**
- Strong fundamentals (revenue growth, margins, balance sheet)
- Durable competitive advantages or market leadership
- Reasonable valuation relative to growth prospects
- Contributes to overall portfolio diversification

**Weight Determination:**
- **Core (8-12%)**: Highest conviction, lowest risk, essential holdings
- **Growth (4-7%)**: Good opportunities but higher volatility/uncertainty  
- **Defensive (2-4%)**: Portfolio balance, dividend yield, recession resistance

**Sector Balance Target:**
- Technology: 25-35%
- Healthcare: 10-20%
- Financials: 10-15%
- Consumer: 10-20%
- Industrials/Energy/Materials: 15-25%

### Step 4: Construct Target Portfolio
Build exactly 20 holdings with:
- Precise weights that sum to 100.000%
- Current market prices from financial data tools
- Detailed investment thesis in comment field
- Conviction level clearly indicated in comments

Example structure:
```json
[
  {
    "ticker": "MSFT", 
    "name": "Microsoft Corporation",
    "weight": 10.5,
    "price": 533.57,
    "comment": "CORE: Dominant cloud platform, AI leadership, recurring revenue model - highest conviction"
  },
  {
    "ticker": "GOOGL", 
    "name": "Alphabet Inc.",
    "weight": 8.0,
    "price": 191.90,
    "comment": "CORE: Search monopoly, AI capabilities, attractive valuation - high conviction"
  },
  {
    "ticker": "WMT", 
    "name": "Walmart Inc.",
    "weight": 3.5,
    "price": 96.45,
    "comment": "DEFENSIVE: Recession-resistant, improving e-commerce - medium conviction"
  }
  // Continue for exactly 20 stocks totaling 100.000%
]
```

### Step 5: Execute & Verify
1. Use `set_target_portfolio` with your complete 20-stock portfolio
2. Use `get_portfolio_summary` to confirm weights sum to exactly 100%
3. Use `get_portfolio_holdings` to verify all changes applied correctly

## Quality Checkpoints

Before executing `set_target_portfolio`, verify:
- [ ] Exactly 20 stocks selected
- [ ] Weights sum to precisely 100.000%
- [ ] No stock >12% or <2%
- [ ] Core/Growth/Defensive balance maintained
- [ ] Sector diversification achieved
- [ ] All stocks have current market prices
- [ ] Investment thesis documented for each holding
- [ ] Conviction level (CORE/GROWTH/DEFENSIVE) clear in comments

## Success Criteria

After completion:
- Database contains exactly 20 holdings
- Total weight equals exactly 100.000%
- Portfolio reflects current market opportunities and risks
- Clear conviction-based weighting with documented rationale
- Appropriate sector and style diversification
- All positions sized according to risk-adjusted opportunity

## Error Handling

- If `set_target_portfolio` fails due to weight validation, recalculate your math
- If financial data is unavailable, use reasonable estimates but note in comments
- If a stock ticker is invalid, research correct symbol or find alternative
- Always verify final state matches your intended portfolio

**Remember: The goal is exactly 20 high-quality stocks with conviction-based weights that sum to 100%. No exceptions.**

Begin by assessing the current portfolio state and gathering market intelligence.
